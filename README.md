# R-Assignments
* Vectors - 
A vector is simply a list of items that are of the same type.
To combine the list of items to a vector, use the c() function and separate the items by a comma.
* Lists - 
A list in R can contain many different data types inside it. A list is a collection of data which is ordered and changeable.
* Arrays -
Compared to matrices, arrays can have more than two dimensions.
We can use the array() function to create an array.
* Matrices -
A matrix is a two dimensional data set with columns and rows.
A column is a vertical representation of data, while a row is a horizontal representation of data.
A matrix can be created with the matrix() function. 
* Data Frames -
Data Frames are data displayed in a format as a table.
Data Frames can have different types of data inside it. While the first column can be character, the second and third can be numeric or logical. However, each column should have the same type of data.
* Factors - 
Factors are used to categorize data.
To create a factor, use the factor() function and add a vector as argument.
* If statement - 
An "if statement" is written with the if keyword, and it is used to specify a block of code to be executed if a condition is TRUE.
* While loop -
It is a type of control statement which will run a statement or a set of statements repeatedly unless the given condition becomes false.
* For loop - 
A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence. for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a vector, array, list, etc..
